# Sample Robot Code for FRC Team 2658
This code is meant to be my own example robot code, primarily showing swerve and telemetry code.

## Features

### Swerve Drive
This code features a swerve drive, set up with CANSparkMax motor controllers. It also includes preset constants for our 2024 robot, but they can be changed from the Constants file.

### Telemetry
This repository will also have some sample code using FRC Team 6328 Mechanical Advantage's AdvantageKit Telemetry library.
